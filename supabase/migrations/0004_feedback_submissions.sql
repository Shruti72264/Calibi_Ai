-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0004 — candidate feedback (`feedback_submissions`)
-- Run in the Supabase SQL editor (or `supabase db push`). Idempotent.
--
-- "Which candidate gave which feedback": the post-assessment form now writes
-- every submission here (and mirrors it into the local JSON store so demo mode
-- still works), and /admin reads it back per student. Supabase is the only
-- destination for assessment feedback; the former external notification is no
-- longer used.
--
-- Notes on the shape:
--   * `student_id` is nullable: the seeded/demo candidates carry short `u_…`
--     ids that cannot be stored in a `uuid` column, so the raw id is kept in
--     `student_ref` and the email is stored too. The dashboard matches feedback
--     to a student by id **or** email, so both cases work.
--   * `session_id` is text (assessment session ids are UUIDs for real sessions
--     but `sess_…` for the demo data).
--   * inserts are allowed for anyone (it is a feedback form, like a contact
--     form); reads are self-scoped and the admin reads with the service role.

-- ============================================================================
-- Optional convenience: expose the latest feedback on the export view so a
-- plain `select * from public.student_profiles_full` also carries it. The app
-- does NOT depend on this — /admin joins feedback itself (so it works whether
-- or not this migration has been applied) — but it keeps the SQL view useful
-- for manual exports. Skipped automatically when migration 0003 has not run,
-- or when the view already has the canonical shape.
--
-- The rebuilt view uses the SAME column list as migration 0006 and
-- supabase/schema.sql (assessment_attempted included), so whichever order the
-- files are applied in, `student_profiles_full` converges on one 38-column
-- shape instead of losing a column to the file that ran last.
