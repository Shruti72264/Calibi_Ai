-- ============================================================================
-- Migration 0002 — profile avatar + one-table "download everything" view
-- Run in the Supabase SQL editor (or `supabase db push`). Idempotent.
--
-- 1. public.profiles.ai_avatar  — the generated AI avatar config
--    ({ seed, style, version, generated_at }) so the same animated avatar
--    renders identically on every device and can be exported/downloaded.
-- 2. public.student_profiles_full — a read-only view that flattens a student's
--    profile + latest resume analysis + latest assessment result into ONE row.
--    Open it in the Supabase table editor and use "Export CSV / Excel / JSON"
--    to download every student's complete record in a single click.
--
-- Re-running this migration on a database that already ran 0003/0004/0006 must
-- NOT touch the view: those migrations widened it (prn, feedback_*,
-- assessment_attempted) and PostgreSQL refuses `create or replace view` when the
-- new definition drops columns that the existing view has
-- (ERROR 42P16: cannot drop columns from view). So the view is only created
-- when it is not there yet — this migration is the one that introduces it.
